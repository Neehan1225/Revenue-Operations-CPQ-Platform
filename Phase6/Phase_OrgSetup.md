## Step 2 â€” Invoice Auto-Population Flow

- Built a **Record-Triggered Flow** on Invoice.  
- **Logic:**  
  1. **Get Related Quote** â€“ Fetch Quote using `Quote__c`.  
  2. **Update Invoice Fields** â€“ Auto-populate values:  
     - `Amount__c = Quote.TotalPrice`  
     - `Due_Date__c = Quote.ExpirationDate`  
     - `Status__c = "Sent"`

- Prevents saving invalid Invoice records.

  - Auto-update Invoice fields for reliability.
